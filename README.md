I used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

This project contains instructions in Turkish. 

I am created a data analysis and machine learning project on a heart attack and prediction dataset. The project uses raw data in form of CSV and transforms it into data analysis. 

I am used Python and Jupyter to perform my analysis and develop my algorithms. Predicting heart attacks before they happen is considered one of the most important subjects in clinical data analysis. In this digitalized era, the amount of data in healthcare is large, and making use of the raw data through analysis helps to make informed decisions and predictions in the future.
